Hello. My name is Doctor Evil. 

Three words to describe me:
- Evil
- Genius
- Father

The details of my life are quite inconsequential...
Very well. Where do I begin? 
My father was a relentlessly self-improving boulangerie owner from Belgium with low-grade narcolepsy and a penchant for buggery. 
My mother was a 15-year-old French prostitute named Chloe with webbed feet. 
My father would womanize; he would drink. He would make outrageous claims like he invented the question mark. 
Sometimes, he would accuse chestnuts of being lazy. The sort of general malaise that only the genius possess and the insane lament... 
My childhood was typical: summers in Rangoon... luge lessons... In the spring, we'd make meat helmets... 
When I was insolent I was placed in a burlap bag and beaten with reeds — pretty standard, really. 

My favorite hobby is my perpetual desire to take over the world. 
I generally do this by holding global powers hostage with my nuclear arsenal, forcing them to pay large sums of money - even one million dollars.
Most of the money goes towards the research and development of futuristic weapons and projects.
My projects include a BigBoy rocketship and cryogenic chamber... fem-bot assassins... and of course, - sharks with "lazer beams" attached to their heads... pretty scary if you ask me.

I also have a son, Scott. 
Scott is a good boy, but he doesn't seem to enjoy evil things like his dad. 
This disappoints me as he was conceived so that he could continue my quest for world domination.
Though I do love him, I've made several subtle, yet unsuccessful, attempts to kill him.
You may be thinking to yourself, "Surely a genius as evil and clever as you would have taken over the world by now."
Perplexing as it may be, there is still one man who stands in my way – his name is...

Austin Powers.
